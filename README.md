# CoDUO Dockerized XLRStats + B3 Stack

This is a docker project that utilizes [XLRStats](https://github.com/XLRstats/xlrstats-web-v3/tree/master) and [BigBrotherBot](https://github.com/BigBrotherBot/big-brother-bot) for server management/stat tracking for Call Of Duty: United Offensive

Both projects are unmaintained.

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. DO NOT PUT ON PUBLIC INTERNET. I HAVE NOT FIXED ANY ISSUES WITH THESE PROJECTS ONLY PUT THEM IN DOCKER CONTAINER

## Installation

Copy files to the same machine running the CoDUO server. Edit .env-default values to match your environment and save as .env

Run docker compose up
